Weekend variation tell us that leisure activities can be a driver for demand, however the decrease could be impacted by location demand changes due to not needed to use the service for work, travel outside the city or other transportation preference that may be impacted by weather or greater distance covered in less time.

## Unusual Performance 
A set of dates was observed with the lowest usage performance, with fewer than 355 rides in a day. Taking Christmas as an assumed outlier, each of those dates showed a significant deviation from normal bike usage patterns. External factors such as weather and city events played a crucial role in the reduction of rides. The consistent trend indicates that unfavorable conditions—whether environmental, logistical, or cultural—lead to marked decreases in Citi Bike usage.
